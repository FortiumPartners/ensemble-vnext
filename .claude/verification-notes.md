# Verification notes

What the verifier has learned about running this project, across runs of the
functional-verification loop. Every line carries an evidence marker: `[ran]` (executed and
read the output), `[read]` (opened and verified), `[inferred]` (deduced, not checked).

## Exercising `renderWaveProfile()` (task-graph.js)

- [ran] `renderWaveProfile()` can be exercised directly with no server, browser, or full
  `/create-trd` run — invoke it in a one-off `node -e` script requiring
  `.claude/lib/task-graph.js` and `.claude/lib/trd-parser.js`, parse a committed TRD with
  `parseTrd(fs.readFileSync(f,'utf8'), {path:f})`, then call
  `tg.renderWaveProfile(tg.buildGraph(p.tasks, p.grounding||{}))`. Confirmed against
  `docs/TRD/autonomy-judge-command-scope.md` (dependency-dominated, 13/14 ordering
  constraints, narrow line + critical path emitted, no shared-files list),
  `docs/TRD/discipline-judgment.md` (avg width 7.00, no narrow line — wide as documented),
  and `docs/TRD/completed/implement-trd-rework.md` (avg width 2.38, above the narrowBelow
  default of 2, no narrow line).
- [ran] A file-dominated wave profile has no committed TRD example in this repo as of
  2026-09-21 (all three referenced example TRDs are dependency-dominated or wide/zero-edge).
  To exercise the "shared files" branch of `renderWaveProfile`, build a synthetic graph
  inline: `buildGraph(tasks, grounding)` takes tasks with no `dependsOn` and a `grounding`
  object keyed by task id with a `touches: [<path>]` array — giving 4 tasks the same
  `touches` path produces `narrow — driven by shared files (6 of 6 ordering constraints)`
  plus the "these files serialize the most tasks" block. This is the substituted-evidence
  path referenced by the contract's "Evidence that would prove it is a target, not a
  contract" clause, used because FS-2 requires a file-dominated contrast run and none
  exists as committed TRD fixture data.
- [inferred] FS-4/FS-5/FS-6 (grounding's dependency-justification verdicts, sizing's
  long-task splits, and TRD-byte-identity-plus-no-AskUserQuestion) require a full
  `/create-trd` run against a real PRD, which the stack hints in this loop's dispatch state
  takes ~20 minutes. Not attempted in this Exercise pass — no PRD was supplied and the
  time cost is out of scope for a single exercise iteration. Left `not_verifiable` with
  that reason; a future run with a PRD in hand and time budgeted for a full pipeline pass
  could produce this evidence.

## Exercising plan-weight.js / fix-plan.js / fix-sizing.js (2026-09-23 run)

- [ran] `plan-weight.js`'s `KINDS`/`WEIGHTS`/`ROUTES` exports, `stages()`, `verification()` and
  `route()`, plus `fix-plan.js`'s `plan()`, are all exercisable with no server, browser or
  live `/plan` session via a one-off `node -e` script requiring
  `./packages/core/lib/plan-weight.js` and `./packages/core/lib/fix-plan.js` directly. No TRD
  or PRD fixture is needed for these — pure functions, no filesystem reads.
- [ran] `fix-sizing.js` no longer exports `MAX_TASKS`/`DEFAULT_MAX_FILES`/`DEFAULT_MAX_CALLERS`
  — confirmed by reading the file and by `grep -rn "MAX_TASKS\|DEFAULT_MAX_FILES" packages/core/lib/*.js`
  returning zero hits, contrasted with the same file at base commit `f5890c8` (`git show
  f5890c8:packages/core/lib/fix-sizing.js`), which defined all three. Any future criterion
  phrased as "the ceiling remains N" needs to be read against its cited source's actual
  wording (does the source forbid *raising*, or forbid *removing*?) before treating a
  deletion as a pass or a fail — those are different claims and the delivered code here
  satisfies one and not the other verbatim.
- [inferred] Criteria naming a full `/plan` *run* (a captured session transcript showing
  actual dispatch behaviour, stage execution, banner counts, `AskUserQuestion` absence, or a
  written artifact from a real run) still require the same ~20-minute live session the prior
  Exercise pass on this project flagged for `/create-trd`. No environment beyond the working
  tree is authorized by `.claude/rules/verification.md` (its `local` row names a `npm run dev`
  script that does not exist in this repo), so these were left `not_verifiable` again this
  run, same reasoning as the prior entry. This applies to: FS-9, FS-19, FS-20, FS-21 (needs a
  TRD `/plan` actually wrote, not a synthetic fixture), FS-22, FS-24.
